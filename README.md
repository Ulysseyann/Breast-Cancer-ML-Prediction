## Introduction

Breast cancer is a significant health concern globally. Early prediction of mortality and survival can greatly influence treatment plans and patient outcomes. This project aims to leverage various machine learning techniques to provide insights into breast cancer prognosis.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes classification, regression, and ensemble techniques to analyze clinical data. The goal is to predict two key outcomes: 

1. **Mortality Status**: Whether a patient is likely to survive or not.
2. **Survival Months**: The estimated number of months a patient is expected to survive.

The project includes comprehensive model evaluation, data preprocessing steps, and interpretability features to make the results understandable.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and documentation.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in machine learning. This project includes:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for prediction.
- **Normalization**: Scaling features to improve model performance.
- **Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into numerical formats.

These steps ensure that the models trained on the data are robust and reliable.

## Modeling Techniques

The project implements several machine learning algorithms:

- **Decision Trees**: A simple yet powerful model that splits data based on feature values.
- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for binary classification.
- **NaÃ¯ve Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Techniques like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting that combine multiple models for better accuracy.

Each model has its strengths and is evaluated based on its performance metrics.

## Model Evaluation

Model evaluation is essential to understand how well the models perform. This project uses:

- **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize the performance of classification models.
- **Accuracy Score**: To measure the overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision and Recall**: To evaluate the model's performance on positive cases.
- **F1 Score**: To find the balance between precision and recall.

The evaluation process helps in selecting the best model for prediction.

## Interpretability

Understanding how models make predictions is vital, especially in healthcare. This project includes:

- **Feature Importance**: Identifying which features most influence predictions.
- **SHAP Values**: A method to explain individual predictions and their contributing factors.

These tools enhance trust in the model's predictions and provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals.
